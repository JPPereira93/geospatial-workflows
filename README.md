## FFSM first run

For good practices and avoid dependencies conflicts:

1) Create a anaconda environment specifically for geospatial operations / remote sensing
2) Install packages using ffsm_requirements.txt
3) Import aux_functions from Geospatial Ops

In wfs task notebook there are present good practices (creating a anaconda environment, installing ipykernel, installing uv, installing geospatial through uv) so that every cell is replicable accordingly to the chosen python environment.
